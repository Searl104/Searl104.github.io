        `Caelynn, Lokt, Ordrin, Emerald, Verna, Galant, and Adara traveled to Renston to investigate a kobold problem. There they raided the lizard's cave, eliminating many of the creatures.
    <p>In the depths they fought a shaman like kobold who commanded a pair of ogres. With the foes defeated, the party took their pick of a treasure hoard. They left the egg clutch intact with a warning and departed for home.
