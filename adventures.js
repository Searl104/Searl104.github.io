        "Adventure 1: Caverns and Kobolds",
    `Caelynn, Lokt, Ordrin, Emerald, Verna, Galant, and Adara traveled to Renston to investigate a kobold problem. There they raided the lizard's cave, eliminating many of the creatures.
    <p>In the depths they fought a shaman like kobold who commanded a pair of ogres. With the foes defeated, the party took their pick of a treasure hoard. They left the egg clutch intact with a warning and departed for home.
    <p>- Recorded by Ordrin`),

        "Adventure 2 : After Andrews",
    `Ordrin, Lokt, Thalion and Verna team up to bring in Andrews and his gang. After a close encounter with a waterfall, Verna lets Ordrin take the role of navigator.
    <p>They find the coast and make camp, but that night a powerful storm forces them to seek shelter. An old couple allow them to stay in their home. The next morning they continue tracking the hoofprints of the bandit troupe.
    <p>They were side tracked by exploring a sea cave. The home of a sea beast and a mysterious door. After becoming cornered by the beast and an encroaching tide, they managed to defeat the creature. Failing to open the door however, they decided to continue down the coast.
    <p>At the base of a rocky cliff they were ambushed by the gang. Arrows rained from above as they tried to slip away. It was an uphill battle. Though three of the gang managed to escape, two were captured and another killed. All three were taken back to Northreach.`),

        "Adventure 3: Squirrel Shenanigans",
    `Caelynn, Lokt, Ordrin, Emerald, Verna, Thalion, and Adara set out from town to begin investigating the copper-thieving squirrels. After spending some time wandering the woods, setting out copper as bait, and only catching glimpses of the fast creatures they finally met one. Thalion killed one of the shapeshifting squirrels (and is now in very bad standing with them) but managed to catch the next one he saw. Emerald then befriended the creature, who she named chip.
    <p>Emerald was able to communicate to Chip to lead us to where they take the copper. On the journey Caelynn fell in a large pit, where the party then fought and defeated four giant spiders.
    <p>Arriving at the home of the squirrel sprites more copper was given, and the squirrels rushed to a well. Upon throwing coins in the well the party found the coins magically disappeared, and the giver was gifted with an enhanced ability.
    <p>Swimming down the well the party found an open (dry) room, with another mysterious door at the end. Four lights on the wall were shown to be eye-like constructs acting as sentries telling the group to stay back from the door. Lokt and Ordrin were able to communicate with the sentries in draconic, receiving translations of the undercommon writings found on the doors and well. They were told this place was the Alms House of Il'manieri, and were given a point on the map of the Temple of Il'manieri. This temple being where to get proper permission to enter the doors, the party decided not to fight the sentries but headed back to town.`),

        "Adventure 4: Bullywug Bog",
     `Caelynn, Lokt, Ordrin, Emerald, Verna, Thalion, and Adara headed southwest out of town to explore that diresction. They ran into an old disheveled woman heading toward town who asked them to look for a specific porous mushroom.
     <p>They went out through the bog, and met a group of bullywugs. The frog creatures demanded tribute, and each party member handed over something. They in turn received pendant necklaces, seeming to indicate free passage through the bog territory.
     <p>Finding the coast line the group headed east and found an old tower full of swamp gas. Heading down into the tower they fought some mold creatures, found a lonely construct, and made it to some chests at the bottom. Lokt took the construct back to town to keep in the Order's base house until they can transport it to the well in the northwest.`),

        "Adventure 5: The Wailing Mountains",
        `Readying to head out to explore the mountains, the party was joined by Adrille (“just call me Adri! Some call me Adel though...”), a slightly excitable gnome with a big stick and an even bigger sense of adventure.
<p>The first day of travel was quiet. Adara found some ‘rock mushrooms’ and tucked 3 into her bag for later reference. Adrille, happy to be out beyond the walls, ran all over, finding some badger dens, but little else.
<p>The second evening, well into the mountain range, Adri helped find a small cave while looking for shelter. But it was already occupied by a large white creature. Noting a larger cave near by, the party opted to take shelter in it, leading to yet another quiet night.
<p>A beautifully sunny day nearly lead to disaster when the snow and ice they were crossing gave way in a sizable landslide. Thankfully everyone was quick enough to get to safety. While mapping, the party almost lost Adri to a huge flying creature, but it decided the small bite wasn’t worth the beating it was getting from the party, and decided to leave emptied clawed.
<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent hiking, mapping, and seeing the weather quickly change from clear to swirling snow. Someone spotted a line of figures moving in in the distance, and hoping to find shelter from the storm, the party opted to follow the figures, eventually losing them entirely, only to be attacked by 4 ‘Frozen Souls’. After a chilling battle (the creatures having disintegrated into the storm one by one) the party dug into the ice and snow under an outcrop, making themselves something of an igloo to pass the storm in.
<p>During the night, Verna spotted the same creature she had seen sleeping in the cave, now making its way dangerously close to their camp site. She very nearly managed to turn it away, but it looped around the outcrop that we had dug in to the side of, and stuck its horned head right into the opening that Ordrin was guarding. He was able to make a solid attack against it, but was petrified and badly wounded in return. It snatched him out of the igloo and began to take off with him in its mouth. Adri was first after him, but it was pure luck and quick thinking that Ordrin tried ordering the beast in infernal to drop him. Shockingly, it not only complied, but apologized and wandered away peacefully.
<p>After breaking camp the next morning, the storm having passed in the night, we spotted some kind of structure sticking out of the snow on another nearby mountainside. It took most of the day to get there, including the time it took to hunt and resupply in the forest valley we passed through. Approaching the structure, we found ourselves gazing up at an ancient, impressive tower. Like and yet more grand then the one half sunk in the swamp. 
<p>While Verna climbed the 60 feet to the first row of windows (noting a room of mirrors before making her way back down) Adara, Adri, and Ordrin took a few good tries before breaking the door in, finding that it opened into a tiled hallway. The first door we came to was locked tightly. Further down the hall, we found something of a small library through an arch to the right. A couple of crumbling books and a rolled up painting of a winter city were stowed away in Ordrin’s pack to go back to be studied in Northreach.
<p>Adara began to wander off, opening a door with a single touch and making her way down another long hallway. Entirely unresponsive and unstoppable, all attempts to communicate or interrupt her motion were met with failure or even a powerful withering attack. Taking all kinds of non- lethal attacks from her teammates trying to stop her and pushing past Ordrin into another room, she began swinging her axe time and again onto a broken construct on the floor next to a humanoid skeleton. Taking some internal piece from the shattered construct, she snapped it in her hands; moments later snapping out of her strange trance, much to the confusion and relief of the somewhat battered party. 
<p>Opting to make use of the shelter the tower provided, the party took a short rest to recover and explore this level of the tower further. Having found a small key on the skeleton, Ordrin was able to unlock the first door we had tried, finding it to be to an office of sorts, where he found and copied down a few ancient star charts. Adara and Verna found some further work space, and something that may have once been a dining room. Adri found a room with 4 mirrors, one of which didn’t show her reflection but a room that contained a cone from which a drop of liquid slowly gathered at the tip of and rose upwards. They turned up a few more of the strange jade coins in addition to their other findings, and decided it was best to began their journey back to the warmth and safety of Northreach.`)
